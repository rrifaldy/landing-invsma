                  Sharia shares are shares issued by a company (Issuer) and in
                  accordance with Islamic sharia principles. In this context,
                  sharia means that investing in such stocks does not involve
                  elements that are prohibited in Islam, such as riba
                  (interest), gharar (uncertainty), and haram (prohibited
                  activities or goods).
